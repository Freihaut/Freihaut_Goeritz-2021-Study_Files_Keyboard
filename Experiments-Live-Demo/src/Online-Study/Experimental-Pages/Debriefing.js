                                You counted a total of {this.props.ans} squares and there were a total of {this.props.solution} squares.

                                In this study, it was not important whether the squares you counted matched the number of squares shown. It therefore was not a test in a classical sense. The aim of this study was to find out whether the use of a computer mouse and keyboard is influenced by stress.
                                By counting squares {this.props.condition === 0 ? " and announcing a performance test" : ""}, stress should be caused in a part of the participants. We ask you for your understanding if this study was stressfull for you. If you are still feeling tense at the moment, please take some time for yourself to relax.
